# Active Context: EPUB Exporter

## Current Work
- Keeping documentation aligned with the selection-based workflow
- Refreshing contributor guidance for both developers and AI agents
- Verifying architecture notes against the current implementation

## Recent Changes
- Updated the Russian quick brief to reflect text selection
- Synced the README with actual extension behavior
- Reconfirmed extension architecture from `manifest.json`

## Next Steps
1. Keep selection and image-handling docs consistent across files
2. Expand customization examples for tables, captions, and other edge cases
3. Update technical context when Chrome or Selection APIs change
4. Monitor EPUB generation performance on very large selections

## Key Considerations
- Accuracy of processing user-selected content
- Compliance with EPUB specifications and package structure
- Service worker performance on large selections
- Simplicity of the user flow: select → export → download
